# Trello MERN front-end
In this folder I have the client-side code that handles the view and front-end logic operations using the web components to modularize the code in different folder both containing jsx and scss. Likewise I have the intention to do the same with the actions and the reducers in order to prevent the code from being all in only one file full of actions and/or reducers.

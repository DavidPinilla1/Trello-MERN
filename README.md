# Trello MERN Stack
In this project I am going to replicate the Trello one using the same tecnologies as they do in the frontend( like React, and Redux for the front-end), whilst in the backend I have set up a MongoDB as database, mongoose to define models and customized methods and finally express as Framework of nodeJS to handle the backend. All of this in conjuction with other libraries that are very helpful to achieve the goal I have which is to have as many functionalities as the original one has.
## Tecnologies employed

- react
- redux
- redux-thunk
- redux-promise-middleware
- http-proxy-middleware
- react-router-dom
- node-sass
- bcrypt
- cookie-parser
- express
- express-flash
- express-session
- jsonwebtoken
- lodash
- mongoose
- multer
- nodemailer
